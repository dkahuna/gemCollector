CRYSTALS!

##OVERVIEW
A simple game of math with icons(images) to win. 

Not only is this project not difficult for new coders but a good way to keep even the most advanced coder you may know on their toes or even to just warm up before digging deep into a way more advance and complexed project compared to this.

##LET'S GET ROLLING

First see how karats you must collect. Then click on each image and memorize each value given to individual image. With what you know now. Pursue adding up to the value of karats needed to win and once you do or maybe not(lose). 

A new game should start for you to try again to have a winning ratio over your losses.

GOOD LUCK!!!
